# Introduction to NoSQL Databases

> [!WARNING]  
> Read this section carefully before heading further into the materials! If you didn't attend the kick-off session, also check the [session slides](./slides/introduction.pdf).

What are NoSQL database management systems, and how do they differ from relational database management systems? What is the MongoDB database management system, and how can it be used to store and manage data? How can MongoDB be used with the Python programming language to implement a database application? The purpose of this course is to answer these and other questions related to NoSQL database management systems.

During this course, we will learn the principles of NoSQL database management systems, how they differ from relational database management systems and what their benefits, challenges, and practical applications are. The course covers in more detail the principles of a widely adopted MongoDB database management system and how to use it in database application development with the Python programming language.

The scope of the course is 2 credits. The prerequisites for the course are the [Data Management and Databases](https://opinto-opas.haaga-helia.fi/course_unit/SOF001AS2AE) (SOF001AS2AE) and [Python Programming](https://opinto-opas.haaga-helia.fi/course_unit/SOF001AS2AE) (SOF004AS2AE) courses or similar knowledge and skills. The course has no lessons, instead, the course is completed by studying the material and completing the compulsory exercises independently. On top of the exercises, the acquired knowledge and skills are applied in practice by developing a simple programming project with Python.

The course assessment is either pass or fail. A passing completion of the course requires completing _all the exercises_ and _implementing a project of an appropriate scope of complexity_. The four sections of the course describe the requirements of completing each section in more detail. You can complete the course at your own pace and request the credits once the requirements are met.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Deadlines

<!-- TODO -->
_To confirm the course participation, pass the "Introduction to NoSQL database management systems" Moodle exam before Thursday 30.10. at 23:59_ (details in the first, [Introduction to NoSQL database management systems](./material/1-nosql-introduction.md), section). Otherwise, individual sections of the course don't have deadlines, but instead, there's a single _final deadline for the remaining coursework on Sunday 14.12. at 23:59_.
