# Introduction to NoSQL database management systems

> _"When people use the term "NoSQL database", they typically use it to refer to any non-relational database. Some say the term "NoSQL" stands for "non-SQL" while others say it stands for "not only SQL". Either way, most agree that NoSQL databases store data in a more natural and flexible way. NoSQL, as opposed to SQL, is a database management approach, whereas SQL is just a query language, similar to the query languages of NoSQL databases."_

In the first part of the course, we will learn the principles of the NoSQL database management systems. During this part you will learn about the  the main characteristics of NoSQL databases, the main differences between NoSQL and relational databases, and the main application areas of NoSQL databases.

NoSQL databases are a family of databases that differ from the relational databases. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) document database, [Redis](https://redis.io/) key-value database and [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) graph database are examples of such databases. NoSQL databases are widely adopted. Based on the [State of Database Survey](https://stateofdb.com/) in 2023, almost 75% of respondeds have used a NoSQL database and two NoSQL databases were among the top five most used databases.

Familiarize yourself with the NoSQL database management systems by reading the article [What is NoSQL?](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/databases/nosql-explained). Once you have read through the article, test your knowledge by completing the "Introduction to NoSQL database management systems" Moodle exam. After passing the exam, you can move on to the next part.

<!-- TODO -->
> [!WARNING]  
> To confirm the course participation, pass the "Introduction to NoSQL database management systems" Moodle exam before Friday 3.4. at 8:00.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Exercise 1 👨‍💻: Read the article mentioned above. Then, take and pass the "Introduction to NoSQL database management systems" multiple-choice Moodle exam related to the principles of the NoSQL database management systems.
